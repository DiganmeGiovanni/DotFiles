# DotFiles
This repo contains scripts and config files to automate the installation
and setup of my *nix workstations, please be careful

**Included gifts**
- `bashrc` and `vimrc` -> `setup.sh` on root folder
- Development environments, compilers, package managers,
  runtimes etc -> `development` folder
- My collection of fonts that i've found on da internet ->
  `fonts` folder
- KDE and Plasma shell configuration files for workspaces and
  themes -> `kde` folder

Each folder contains a script to install and setup its contents,
*ensure to run it through `bash` instead of `sh`*
